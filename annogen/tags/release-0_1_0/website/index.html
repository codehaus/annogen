<p>
Annogen is a framework for overriding
<a href='http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=175' target='_blank'>
JSR175
</a> Annotations.
The overrides can be driven by XML or by arbitrary plugin code that
you write.
</p>

<p>
Because Annogen will run under JDK 1.4, it can help your
migrate your application to JSR175 annotations while
continuing to support javadoc tags.
</p>

<p>
Annogen works with a variety of popular Java introspection APIs, including
Reflection, Javadoc-Doclet, APT-Mirror, QDox and JAM.

<h3>News</h3>


<b><i>Tuesday, December 7</i></b>

<p>
In preparation for the move, I've gone ahead and moved everything under
<code>org.codehaus.annogen</code>.  We can finally say what the package
names are going to be.
</p>

<p>
Also, I've created a larger distribution zip that includes sources, docs
and examples.  Well, ok, just one example right now, but it's a start.
To run an example, just 'ant' the build.xml file that is in the root directory
of each one.
</p>

<b><i>Monday, December 6</i></b>

<p>
Great news!  Annogen has been accepted to be a new project at codehaus!
Thanks much to Bob for a superfast response. 
</p>

<b><i>Sunday, December 5</i></b>

<p>
I've had a flurry of interest in annogen in recent days, so I'm putting up
this website as a temporary goto point.  I'm still shopping around for a more
permanent home for annogen and its companion API, JAM.
</p>

<p>
Please be aware that annogen is still under development.  It's
really starting to shape up now, but I'm still not ready to promise that a
few interface names won't change (much less that it is bug free ;) ).
</p>

<p>
Also, the package name (net.pcal) definitely will be changing.  I'm currently
trying to find a more permanent open source home for annogen.
