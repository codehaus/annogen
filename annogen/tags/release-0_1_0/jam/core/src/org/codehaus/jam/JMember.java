/**
 * <p>Represents an abstraction which can be member of a class.  Such
 * abstractions include: constructors, methods, fields, and classes
 * (in the case of inner classes).  JMember's share the following
 * attributes in common: they have some level of access protection
 * (public/protected/private) and are (usually) contained within a
 * class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because classes themselves can be members of other classes,
 * JClass extends JMember.  In the case where a JClass represents a
 * top-level class (i.e. not an inner class),
 * JMember.getContainingClass() will always return null.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the various access protection levels are all mutually
 * exclusive.  For a given abstraction, only one of isPrivate(),
 * isPackagePrivate(), isProtected(), or isPublic() will return true.
 * Note that this information is also exposed via getModifiers(),
 * which returns a bit-field that is identical to that described in
 * java.lang.reflect.Modifier.</p>
