/**
 * <p>Represents a member value of a JAnnotation.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>A note regarding enums</b></p>
 *
 * <p>The presence of metadata of 'enum' types poses a bit of a challenge
 * in the untyped view of metadata that is presented by JAnnotationValue.
 * Because JAM cannot assume that the enum definitions have been compiled,
 * it is not possible for JAM to return an instance of an enumuerated type.
 * In other words, it is not possible for JAnnotationValue to provide an
 * asEnum() method.</p>
 *
 * <p>If JAM encounters an annotation value of an enumerated type, it will
 * represent it with a JAnnotationValue such that calling <code>
 * myAnnotationValue.getType().isEnumType()</code> will return true.
 * Moreover, calling <code>myAnnotationValue.asString()</code> will return
 * the name of the enumeration field, exactly as it appears in the
 * type declaration.
 * </p>
