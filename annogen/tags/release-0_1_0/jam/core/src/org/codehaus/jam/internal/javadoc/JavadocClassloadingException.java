    "tools.jar but ignores one that may have already been set, which leads\n"+
    "to some classes being loaded into two different classloaders.  The\n"+
    "telltale sign of this problem is a javadoc error message saying that\n"+
    "'languageVersion() must return LanguageVersion - you might see this\n"+
    "message in your process' output.\n"+
