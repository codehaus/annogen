    Provides a modifiable view of the JElement tree.  This package contains
    interfaces which parallel and extend the JElement tree, adding and
    editing functionality to that the view of the java type system can
    be modified.

    Typically, this is only used in conjunction with an 'initializer'
    ElementVisitor which is run on a JClass when it is first loaded.  The
    initializer might use these editable 'M*' abstractions to, for example,
    do some pre-processing on the comments or annotations, or to determine
    which methods on a class should be exposed as JProperties.  The M*
    classes are also used by JAM providers in implementing the JamClassBuilder
    interface, which populates an EClass with methods, fields, and so on.

    It is also possible to use this package to synthesize a view
    of a java class which does not actually exist in any class or source
    file.  This could be useful, for example, to drive a code-generation
    mechanism (Note that JAM does not provide a model for the contents of
    method bodies, so this may not be a useful approach).
