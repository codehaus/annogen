  This example supposes that we have a User who needs to deploy some
  'Beans' contained in 'myjar' using the DeployerTool.  Those Beans
  have JSR175 DeploymentInfo annotations which specifies a 'cacheSize'
  value for a Bean cache that is created when the Bean is deployed.
 </p>

 <p>
  Unfortunately, the developer of one of the beans in 'myjar' set
  the cacheSize to be way too small for the User, and they need to
  increase it.  Fortunately, for the User, the DeployerTool supports
  an AnnoOverrider which will allow them to specify alternate values
  for cacheSize for any of the beans.
