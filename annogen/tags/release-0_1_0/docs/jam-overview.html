  <h1>JAM - Overview</h1>

  <p>
    JAM is an object model for Java types and their associated annotations.
    It provides a superset of the features offered by similar APIs
    (such as Reflection or X/Javadoc), including a unique extensibility
    mechanism specifically designed to help Java developers cope with the
    rapidly-changing world of Java metadata.  

  <h3>Why?</h3>

  <p>
    There already are a number of ways in which you can inspect and
    model Java types.  Java reflection, of course, can be used to
    introspect loaded classes, while tools such as X/Javadoc or Qdox
    can parse java sources and give you model of their contents
    (including comments and other information that is lost during java
    compilation).
  </p>

  <p>
    But consider the case where you want to inspect a set of java types
    where you have source files for some of the types, but only classfiles
    for others.  And what if you want to be able to access the comments
    for your java types when they are available from source, but still
    process them sans comments when you only have classfiles?  One approach
    would be to write one version of your program's logic that works
    against the Reflection API, and another that works with Javadoc's
    Doclet API.  But that seems rather painful - isn't there a better 
    way?
  </p>


<h3>Artifact Agnosticism</h3>

  <p>
    JAM solves this (and many other problems, as we will see) by creating 
    an insulating layer between your code and the real artifacts which
    describe the java types your code needs to view.  The JAM API was
    designed from the ground up to allow you to write code that is
    completely <i>artifact agnostic</i> when inspecting java types. 
    That is to say, JAM provides a set of
    abstractions which isolate your java type-inspecting code from the
    files that it is actually looking  at.  This means that you get a
    single API with which you can view java sources and classfiles.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a given instance of JClass (JAM's abstract representation
    of a Java class) may in reality represent the contents of either a 
    <code>.class</code> file or its corresponding <code>.java</code> 
    source file.  However, the JClass that your code sees looks exactly
    the same in either case.  Without JAM, you may have to write your code
    twice using two separate APIs like Javadoc and Reflection.  With JAM,
    your code more able to focus on the logic that is central to your
    application.
  </p>

<h3>Extensibility</h3>

  <p>
    However, the advantages of JAM's beansed design extend far
    beyond simply providing a unified view of java source- and 
    classfiles.  This is because JAM allows you to write your own 
    extensions which customize the proxies that it creates.  With this
    extension mechanism, you can easily add, modify, or remove any 
    part of a beaning built.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, you could write an extension which adds a default comment
    to uncommented methods on a given JClass.  With such an extension
    in place, JClasses loaded by JAM will contain your generated comments
    <i>exactly as if they had actually been in the source file all along.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though this is an extremely simple example, consider how much
    trouble it might save you in a complex application composed of serveral
    subsystems.  Say that those subsystems who ask each other to do things
    using java types that they pass around, and that we need them to use
    default comments.  If we don't have JAM, we're going to have to write
    special logic in each subsystem to generate default comments when
    appropriate.  However, with JAM, we only have to write one bit of code
    that weaves those comments into out proxied view of the Java classes.
    Those subsytems that are consuming this view need be none the wiser.
  </p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>
    If you are working on a project where you need to understand
    what java classes look like, you should consider using JAM.  It 
    allows you to loosely-couple your application from the way in which
    the java classes are parsed or loaded, and it's extensibility
    features can allow you to implement elegant solutions to complex 
    problems involving java type introspection.
