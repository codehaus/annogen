  <h1>JAM - The Java Abstraction Model</h1>

  <p>
    JAM is an object model for Java types and their associated annotations.
    It provides a unified superset of the features offered by similar APIs
    (such as Reflection or X/Javadoc).

  <p>
    JAM is looking pretty solid.  Cedric has converted EJBgen and SGen
    to the updated APIs, and all of his regression tests are passing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that JAM currently is still packaged under
    <code>org.apache.xmlbeans.impl.jam</code>.  I know this looks weird,
    and I am working on finding a better package name.

<h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    JAM has evolved as part my work on
    <a href='http://xml.apache.org/xmlbeans'>XML-Beans</a> at Apache,
    which I do on behalf of my employer,
    <a href='http://www.bea.com'>BEA Systems</a>.
    In XML-Beans, I need to be able model Java types in order to generate
    XML schemas from them.  I found all of the existing Java object models
    (x/javadoc, reflection, qdox) to be lacking in
    some respect.  They each have some features I wanted, but none of them
    brought all of those features together.
  </p>

  <p>
    JAM is now proving to be a generally useful technology in its
    own right.  Most notably, it is already being used in Cedric Beust's
    <a href='http://www.beust.com/ejbgen'>EJBgen</a> and
    <a href='http://www.beust.com/sgen'>SGen</a>.  Accordingly, I am now
    exploring the possibility of spinning it up as a distinct open source
    project, but it doesn't yet have an official open source community.
    Until it does, my website here is serving as a temporary home.
