<h1>Annogen Overview</h1>

<h3>What is Annogen?</h3>

<p>
Annogen is a tool which helps you work with JSR175 annotations, a new
feature in JDK 1.5.
</p>

<h3>What specific problems does Annogen solve?</h3>

<p>
JSR175 is a much-needed improvement to java.  However,
a few challenges may lie in store for developers of <i>frameworks</i> which need to
process JSR175 annotations (hereafter, simply called 'frameworks').
Annogen aims to provide an elegant solution for a few of them:
</p>

<p>
<i>Annotation Overriding</i>
</p>
<p>
Because JSR175 annotations are 'baked-in' to <code>.class</code> files by javac,
frameworks have no elegant way to manipulate the annotation values that were
declared by the class author.
</p>

<p>
<i>Migration from Older JDKs</i>
</p>
Many existing projects may want to start using JSR175 annotations, but will
still need to support older JDKs for some time.  This migration presents a
dilemma because JSR175 annotation types cannot even be classloaded
without JDK 1.5.
</p>

<p>
<i>Disparate Access Models</i>
</p>
Sun has provided new <code>java.lang</code> APIs for strongly-typed access to
JSR175 annotation values.  However, this can only be used to access
annotations which have a 'runtime retention policy;' annotations without
this must be accessed via <code>javadoc</code>, which provides a completely
different, untyped API for viewing annotations.  Mediating between these two
access models could be a problem for frameworks, particularly those which must
access source artifacts not available via reflection, such as javadoc comments.
</p>

<h3>How does Annogen solve those problems?</h3>

<p>
Annogen uses your JSR175 annotation types to code-generate special java beans
called <i>AnnoBeans</i>.  AnnoBeans look exactly like your JSR175 annotations;
in fact, they can actually directly implement your JSR175 annotation
interfaces.  AnnoBeans carry exactly the same data that appears on your
JSR175 annotations.  You write your framework code to use AnnoBeans when it
needs to understand what annotations are on a java class.
</p>

<p>
One big advantage to this approach stems from the fact that AnnoBeans
can be modified.  AnnoBeans start out reflecting the values on the actual
annotations they represent.  You are then given the option to add,
modify, or remove annotation values before they are consumed by your
framework.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage is AnnoBeans do not contain any JDK 1.5-specific
dependencies.  This means that you can load them under JDK 1.4, unlike JSR175
annotations.  Note, however, that AnnoBeans under JDK1.4 cannot be initialized
with values from JSR175 annotations va1because your AnnoBeans cannot will be
empty by default that under JDK1.4. your AnnoBeans cannot
access JSR175 annotation values.  For Annobeans to be useful under 1.4, you
will need to be able to supply an <i>AnnoOverrider</i> which can retrieve
annotation values from some other source, such as javadoc tags or an XML file.
</p>

<p>
A third advantage is that AnnoBeans can be used in conjunction with a
variety of Java introspection APIs, including reflection, javadoc, and JAM.
(Support for other similar APIs can easily be added in the future).  This means
that whether your framework is driven off of class files (via reflection) or
java sources (via javadoc), you have a single, consistent, strongly-typed API
for viewing your annotations.
</p>


<h3>What do I have to do to use Annogen?</h3>

<p>
Use of Annogen is divided into three distinct phases: <i>Generate</i>,
<i>Override</i>, and <i>View</i>.  Each phase has a corresponding
sub-package in the Annogen class hierarchy.
</p>

<p><i>Generate</i></p>

<p>
In the generate phase, Annogen code-generates AnnoBeans from your JSR175
annotation classes.  This should be done as part of the build of your framework,
before your javac your framework sources.  Annogen includes an ant task to
make this easier.  You will also need to make sure that each of your annotation
classes are themselves annotated with a simple annotation, AnnogenInfo,
which tells Annogen the name of the AnnoBean to be generated.
</p>

<p><i>Override</i></p>

<p>
Once you have your AnnoBeans, you can create an <i>AnnoOverrider</i> which
adds, modifies, or remove AnnoBeans associated with a given java class.  How
and when this is done depends upon your needs.  For example, say you had a
'cache size' deployment annotation which your users might occasionally want
to override at deployment time.
You could implement an AnnoOverrider which retrieves the user's override
preferences (say, from an XML file) and then modifies the AnnoBeans
accordingly.
</p>

<p><i>View</i></p>

<p>
In the final step, your framework code reads the AnnoBeans and uses them to
do something interesting with them, such as deploy a user application.  You
retrieve instance of the AnnoBeans through the <i>AnnoViewer</i> interface.
You simply ask the AnnoViewer to give you the AnnoBean for a given annotation
type on a given class.  The AnnoBean you get back may or may not have been
modified by your AnnoOverrider; the nice thing is here that you don't
have to care.  Annogen allows you to maintain a clean separation between
the code which gathers and manipulates annotation values and the code which
acts on those values.

<h3>Can AnnoBeans implement my JSR175 AnnotationTypes?</h3>

<p>
In the <i>Generate</i> phase, you have an option called
'<i>implementAnnotationTypes</i>.'  If true, the generated AnnoBeans will
directly implement your JSR175 types.  The advantage to this approach is that
your framework code in the View phase does not ever have to know about
AnnoBeans - you just use JSR175 annotation types just as you would with regular
reflection.  They will be implemented by AnnoBeans, but your code
doesn't have to know that.  This approach is somewhat simpler, cleaner and may
make it easier to integrate with other code which use the same JSR175 types.
</p>

<p>
The only disadvantage to it is that you sacrifice compatibility withh older
JDKs, where your JSR175 annotation types won't even classload.  But if JDK
1.4 support is not important to you, then you probably should set
implementAnnotationTypes to true and write your View-phase code
against your JSR175 types.
</p>

<p>
Note that in either case, your Override-phase code still must import
AnnoBeans (because JSR175 types don't have setters) and your
View-phase code needs to use an AnnoViewer (because the
JDK doesn't know about your overrides).
