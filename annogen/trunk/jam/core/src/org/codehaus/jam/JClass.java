/**
 * <p>Represents a Java class that may or may not be loaded in the VM.
 * JClass is typically implemented in one of two ways: by wrapping a
 * java.lang.Class or by parsing a source file directly with a tool
 * such as javadoc or javelin.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a JClass represents an inner class, its getParent() method
 * returns the outer class.  Otherwise, it returns the containing
 * package.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Important Note:</b> Because JAM's classloading machinery may swap
 * instances of JClass out of memory at any time, you should never rely on
 * instance equality (i.e., '==') when comparing two JClasses.  To illustrate:
 * it is possible (though rather unlikely) that that the following expression
 * will evaluate to false</p>
 *
 * <code>
 *   JMethod myJMethod = ...
 *   myJMethod.getReturnType() == myJMethod.getReturnType()
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>Instead, you should always use equals()</p>

 * <code>
 *   myJMethod.getReturnType().equals(myJMethod.getReturnType())
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>REVIEW a bunch of these methods (getMethods, getConstructors...)
 * could throw SecurityException if the JClass is backed by
 * java.lang.Class (see javadocs for Class).  We're currently ignoring
 * this, because it seems unlikely and it seems heavyweight.  Seems
 * ok?</p>
