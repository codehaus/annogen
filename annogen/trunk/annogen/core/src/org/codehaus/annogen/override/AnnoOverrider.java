/**
 * <p>
 * Modifes the annotations which apply to some annotated java element.
 * AnnoOverrider is essentially a callback mechanism - it is consulted when
 * an AnnnoViewer receives requests to view the annotations on a particular
 * element.  This model was chosen in the interests of efficiency, since
 * the overrider doesn't have to worry about whether it's wasting time
 * overriding annotations that will never be used anyway.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * However, the callback approach can be ungainly, in the information
 * you need to override annotations may not be readily available to you
 * when it comes time to view the annotations.  To help with this problem,
 * see the StoredAnnoOverrider, which lets you determine your annotation
 * overrides in a single pass and store them for later use in the View phase.
 * </p>
